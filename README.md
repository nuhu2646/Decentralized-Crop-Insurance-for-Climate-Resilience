# Decentralized Crop Insurance for Climate Resilience (DCICR)

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, efficient, and automated climate risk management for farmers.

## Overview

The Decentralized Crop Insurance for Climate Resilience (DCICR) platform leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to revolutionize agricultural insurance. By combining immutable farm records, verified climate data, algorithmic risk assessment, and automatic parametric payouts, this system provides affordable and accessible insurance coverage to farmers worldwide, particularly those vulnerable to increasing climate volatility.

## System Architecture

The DCICR platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Farm Registration Contract**
    - Records detailed information about agricultural operations
    - Stores geolocation, crop types, farming practices, and historical yields
    - Manages ownership verification and land boundaries
    - Tracks seasonal planting schedules and harvest data
    - Supports integration with existing agricultural registries

2. **Climate Data Oracle Contract**
    - Provides verified and tamper-proof weather and climate information
    - Aggregates data from multiple authoritative meteorological sources
    - Validates and reconciles readings from weather stations and satellites
    - Maintains historical climate records for specific regions
    - Processes advanced climate metrics (precipitation, temperature, wind, soil moisture)

3. **Risk Assessment Contract**
    - Calculates insurance premiums based on location, crops, and climate models
    - Implements actuarial models tailored to regional climate risks
    - Adjusts premiums based on historical data and climate projections
    - Supports dynamic risk scoring as conditions change
    - Facilitates risk pooling across diverse geographic regions

4. **Parametric Payout Contract**
    - Triggers automatic compensation based on predefined climate events
    - Executes payouts without requiring manual claims processing
    - Calculates compensation amounts based on severity of climate events
    - Manages insurance fund reserves and reinsurance mechanisms
    - Provides transparent payout history and event verification

## Key Features

- **Automated Claims Processing**: Eliminates traditional claims adjustment delays and costs
- **Transparent Risk Modeling**: Open algorithms for premium calculation and risk assessment
- **Microinsurance Support**: Enables affordable coverage for smallholder farmers
- **Climate Resilience Incentives**: Premium discounts for adoption of resilient farming practices
- **Fractional Coverage**: Flexible insurance options for partial crop protection
- **Smart Weather Stations**: IoT integration for hyperlocal climate monitoring
- **Global Accessibility**: Designed for farmers in both developed and emerging economies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Truffle framework
- Ganache (for local development)
- Web3.js
- Metamask or similar Ethereum wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/dcicr.git
   cd dcicr
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy to local development blockchain:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure the network settings in `truffle-config.js` for your target deployment network
2. Set up environment variables for API keys and climate data sources
3. Configure regional parameters in `config/climate-thresholds.json`

## Usage

### For Farmers

```javascript
// Example: Registering a farm
const farmContract = await FarmRegistration.deployed();
await farmContract.registerFarm(geolocation, farmSize, cropTypes, farmingPractices);

// Example: Purchasing insurance coverage
const riskContract = await RiskAssessment.deployed();
const premium = await riskContract.calculatePremium(farmId, coveragePeriod, coverageAmount);
await riskContract.purchasePolicy(farmId, premium, coveragePeriod, coverageAmount);
```

### For Insurance Providers

```javascript
// Example: Setting up a new insurance pool
const payoutContract = await ParametricPayout.deployed();
await payoutContract.createInsurancePool(regionIds, capitalReserve, reinsuranceDetails);

// Example: Reviewing risk exposure
const riskExposure = await riskContract.calculateRegionalExposure(regionId, seasonId);
```

### For Weather Data Providers

```javascript
// Example: Registering as an authorized data source
const oracleContract = await ClimateDataOracle.deployed();
await oracleContract.registerDataProvider(providerCredentials, dataTypes, updateFrequency);

// Example: Submitting climate data
await oracleContract.submitClimateData(regionId, dataType, readings, timestamp, providerSignature);
```

### For Climate Scientists

```javascript
// Example: Updating climate risk models
const riskContract = await RiskAssessment.deployed();
await riskContract.updateRiskModel(regionId, modelParameters, scientificValidation);

// Example: Setting parametric triggers for events
const payoutContract = await ParametricPayout.deployed();
await payoutContract.defineEventTriggers(eventType, thresholds, payoutFormula, validationMethod);
```

## Weather Data Integration

The platform integrates with multiple climate data sources:

- Satellite-based precipitation and vegetation indices
- Ground-based weather station networks
- Drone-captured hyperlocal climate data
- Soil moisture sensors and IoT devices
- Historical climate records and seasonal forecasts

## Security Considerations

- **Oracle Security**: Multi-source consensus for climate data verification
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different participants
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Regular security audits required
- **Insurance Fund Security**: Multi-signature requirements for reserve management
- **Data Validation**: Cross-verification of climate event occurrences

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify contract functionality:

```
truffle test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Farm registration and verification
- Climate data ingestion and validation
- Premium calculation and policy issuance
- Parametric event detection and payout execution

## Economic Model

The platform implements a sustainable economic model:

- Risk pooling across diverse geographic regions
- Reinsurance integration for catastrophic events
- Incentives for accurate climate data provision
- Premium discounts for climate-resilient practices
- Liquidity provision through yield farming on reserves

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

For testing on Ethereum testnets:

```
truffle migrate --network sepolia
```

### Production Deployment

For deploying to production networks:

```
truffle migrate --network mainnet
```

## Mobile Application

A companion mobile application provides:
